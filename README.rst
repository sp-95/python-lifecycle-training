Black
=====

**Black** gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from **pycodestyle** nagging about
formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.

**Black** makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible. Blackened
code looks the same regardless of the project youâ€™re reading. Formatting becomes
transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.
