============
Cookiecutter
============

Cookiecutter is a command-line utility that creates projects from project templates.

I have created a cookiecutter using the tools mentioned in this training at
https://github.com/sp-fm/fuse-framework

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install fuse-framework
    $ fuse init

This will prompt some questions related to the project that is being generated.

   :alt: Cookiecutter prompts

Once you fill out all those questions you will have a ready to use skeleton of a project
with all the tools mentioned in this training session. (without the awesome calculator
app of course). Enjoy!!!
