==========
Pre-commit
==========

**Git hook scripts** are useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code
review. **Pre-commit** runs on every commit to automatically point out issues in code
such as trailing whitespace, and debug statements. By pointing these issues out before
code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while
not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks.

**Pre-commit** is a multi-language package manager for pre-commit hooks. You specify a
list of hooks you want and pre-commit manages the installation and execution of any hook
written in any language before every commit. pre-commit is specifically designed to not
require root access. If one of your developers doesnâ€™t have node installed but modifies
a JavaScript file, pre-commit automatically handles downloading and building node to run
eslint without root.

Usage
-----

Pre-commit will run automatically every time you make a commit.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git add .
    $ git commit

.. image:: ../_static/pre-commit/img/run.png
    :alt: Pre-commit output

You can run it manually as well.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pre-commit run

.. image:: ../_static/pre-commit/img/run.png
    :alt: Pre-commit run output

If you want to run pre-commit on all your files:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pre-commit run --all-files

.. image:: ../_static/pre-commit/img/run-all-files.png
    :alt: Pre-commit run all-files output

Or if you want to run pre-commit on specific files/folders:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pre-commit run --files python_lifecycle_training tests

.. image:: ../_static/pre-commit/img/run-files.png
    :alt: Pre-commit run files output

You can also run a specific hook:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pre-commit run flake8 --files tests/calculator/test_simple.py

.. image:: ../_static/pre-commit/img/run-flake8.png
    :alt: Pre-commit run flake8 output

Useful Commands
---------------

You can update your hooks to the latest version automatically by running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pre-commit autoupdate

Advanced features
-----------------

Temporarily disable hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

    $ SKIP=flake8,mypy git commit

.. image:: ../_static/pre-commit/img/run-skip.png
    :alt: Pre-commit output by disabling hooks

Automatically enable pre-commit for all repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

    $ git config --global init.templateDir ~/.git-template
    $ pre-commit init-templatedir ~/.git-template

Add a badge
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen?logo=pre-commit&logoColor=white
    :target: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit
    :alt: pre-commit

.. code-block:: RST

    .. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen?logo=pre-commit&logoColor=white
        :target: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit
        :alt: pre-commit

.. note:: You can remove the unused imports in ``test_simple.py`` to pass flake8 tests.
    You can remove flake8, black, isort and mypy dependencies as well because pre-commit
    has them all covered
